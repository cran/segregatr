\title{segregatr: Segregation Analysis for Identifying Pathogenic Variants}
\description{
An implementation of the full-likelihood Bayes factor (FLB) for evaluating
segregation evidence in clinical medical genetics. The method was introduced
by Thompson et al. (2003), and further popularised by Bayrak-Toydemir et al.
(2008). This implementation allows custom penetrance values and liability
classes, and includes specialised pedigree visualisations.
